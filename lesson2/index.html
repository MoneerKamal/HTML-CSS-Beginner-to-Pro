    <!-- Block VS Inline Elements-->

    <!--
      
    There are two display values: block and inline
    A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
    An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
    The <div> element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
    The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, 
      or a part of a document
